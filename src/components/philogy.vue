<h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
<p>Our scope for investment is worldwide. A series of fully owned and partly acquired portfolios-globally, regionally, and internationally-underpins our wide-ranging network. We are continuously identifying new opportunities that will further our goal of sustainable growth and diversification. With the assets, skills, and incentives, we help our companies to become major competitors.</p>
<p>My goal of establishing Al Nasser Investment Company was to build an institution coupled with dedication and competence in an emerging environment of demanding investment opportunities.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is heading towards, more excellent stability with the help of God the Almighty and with the gracious guidance of our leadership. I hope the best for myself and my colleagues at Al Nasser Investment Company to excel in achieving our leadership aspirations and ambitious standards.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are long-term investors from the Institution to find high-growth investment prospects and profit from industry instabilities and shortfalls.</li>
<li>Our transparency and our shareholder power to enhance the corporate processes should bring value over time to the portfolio.</li>
<li>Our professional management team and the long-term relationships we build with our external managers and advisors are essential to achieving our investment goals.</li>
